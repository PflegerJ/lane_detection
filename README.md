CSS490 (High Performance Computing) at UWB, Final Project: Lane Detection with OpenCV and CUDA. 

The machine used for devlopment was a Windows 8.1 laptop with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 860M GPU.   
Visual Studio 2017 and CUDA version 10.2 were used for development.

Download OpenCV here: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases

Extract the "opencv" to your C: drive. Just put the opencv folder on the C drive.

Instructions here: https://medium.com/@subwaymatch/opencv-410-with-vs-2019-3d0bc0c81d96 **You only need to complete up to Step 2** The rest should already be set-up in the project. **USE VC14, NOT VC15!** Whenever it refers to vc15, *replace with vc14!* This is due to the dev environment being Visual Studio 2017.
